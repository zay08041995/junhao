        <p>“kayo po ba si Chloe xu?”  <br>
            <Br>

            “yes po” sagot ni Chloe  <br>
            <br>
            
            “tara na po” 
             <br>
             pag aya ng grab driver kay chloe saka ini-abot ang helmet sa kanya 
            one of the things Chloe hate is riding motorcycles. at alam yon ng mga friends nya, 
             kaya laking pagtataka nya na lang nung ang dumating sa harapan ng bahay nya ay motorcycle grab  <br>
            <br>
            
            “Tulungan ko na po kayo jan”   
        
            the grab rider said as he help chloe put on the helmet,
            Chloe stood there like a statue and didn&#769;t even move an inch, as the rider help him.
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Hindi nya alam kung paano ipapaliwanag but for some reason, he felt safe in that moment.
             nagtugma ang mga mata nila ng grab driver,  the rider instantly looked away not daring to make any eye contact with the chloe.  <br>
              <br>
              the rider have this black cloth around his face like every other rider have, 
               kaya hindi nya maaninag ang itsura nito<br>
              <br>

            “tara na po?”   <br>
            <br>
            
            “Lets go.”<br>
            <br>
            
            “hawak po kayo ng maghigpit” paalala ng rider.<br>
            <br>
            
            —— umaandar na<br>
            
            habang umaandar ang motor, the rider can&#769;t seem to focus on the road as he ask Chloe   <br>
             <br>
             “okay lang po kayo?” .<br>
            <br>
            “Okay lang.” he tried to hide his nerveousness, as he answered nonchalantly<br>
            <br>
            
            “Kapit po kayong mahigpit” muling pag paalala nito.  <br>
            <br>
            
            kuya rider could feel chloe&#769;s hand in his shoulder, trembling. 
            the only thing he could only do is to assure the latter na hindi pa sila mamatay dito,
             not now—  nor ever—  lalo na&#769;t hindi pa sya 
            nakakapag-sorry rito. <br>

            <br>
            
            as they turn left on the intersection, lalong bumilis ang tibok ng puso ni chloe.
             mas lalo pa syang napakapit sa balikat ng rider, not daring to let go.<br>
            <br>
            
            napansin ito ng rider kaya kinuha nya ang kamay ni chloe at inilagay iyon sa kanyang t'yan for support,
             chloe ended up locking the rider in his arms, hindi mapigilan ng rider ang mapangiti.<br>
             <br>
            
            “Relax, kapit ka lang. hinding-hindi kita hahayaang mahulog" malumanay na saad ng rider<br>
            <br>
            
            laking pasasalamat na lang niya na hindi napansin ni chloe— na ibang daan na pala ang tinatahak nila.<br>
            <br>
            
            ———
            
            “kuya where are we??” pangungulit na tanong ni chloe sa rider ng mapansin nya ang daan na tinatahak nila ay pamilyar<br>
            <br>
            
            he knows this place very well, pero ang pinagtataka nya ay pano alam ng rider ang lugar na to?! Unless he&#769;s…..<br>
            <br>
            
            “Ryan?!” he ask as he realised. ang buong akala nya ay may gusto sa kanya ang rider, dahil na rin sa pag papalumay nito kay chloe.
            <br> well technically meron...  <br>
            <br>
            
            unti-unting inihinto ni Ryan ang motor, at dahan-danhang bumaba, saka tinanggal ang suot na helmet.
             again chloe was left there stunned, ryan offered his hand for help<br>
             <br>
            
            "kaya ko!" chloe exclaimed as he tried getting down the motorcycle,
             he slip but buti nalng ay nasa gilid lamang nya si Ry; Ryan held Chloe like his life depends on it, it is. <br>
             <br>
            
            "okay ka lang?" tanong nito, pag tango lang ng ulo ang natanggap nyang sagot mula rito<br>
                     <br>
          
            
            "oh, sorry" Ryan added as he realise, he was holding chloe's waist <br>
            <br>
            
            --- 
            "bakit tayo andito?" <br>
            <br>
            
            ....<br>
            <br>
            
            "Ry.." chloe called out <br>
            <br>
            
            "I want to explain everything. hindi sa gusto kung linisin ang pangalan ko, kundi para malaman mo ang totoo."<br>
            <br>
            
            "oh please, wala ka ng kailangan na ipaliwanag. as i said before, nakita ko ang lahat, Ry." <br>
            <br>
            
            "Ash is my friend, and that time you saw me.. us. i was helping her. she was being harassed—"<br>
            <br>
            
            "Ryan naman ano tingin mo sa akin, tanga? na maniniwala sa mga sinasabi mo?!"<br>
            
            "bub. let me finish first, please?"<br>
            
            ...
            
            "I couldn&#769;t let Ash be harassed by some random men at the bar. 
            She wasn&#769;t just a friend—she&#769;s also my cousin. I couldn&#769;t leave her in danger,
            especially whe she's helping me plan my proposal to you."<br>

            <br>
            
            "Wait.. What?!! proposal??!" <br>
            <br>
            
            "bub. I was planning on proposing to you that night.
             Ash and I we're just making some few adjustments— to make everything perfect.
             as you deserve everything in this world"  
             Ryan touches Chloe face like it was the precious thing in this world;
              he wiped his lover's tears as they slowly fall down one by one  <br>

              <br>
            
            "why?.. why didn't you tell me?" chloe ask sobbing <br>
            <br>
            
            "edi hindi kana na surprise bub!" Ryan said jokingly<br>
            <br>
            
            "I don't know if you still want to here this," he added 
            without a second thought Ry knelt down, pulling something in his pocket <br>

            <br>
            
            ".. I hate to make the same mistake again. so Chloe Jean Xu..
            will you make me the happiest man alive and marry me?"
           He ask full of hope and love, clutching the red velvet box in his hands  <br>

            <br>
            
            "of course.. YES!" <br>
            <br>
            
            Ryan didn't waste any moment as he lift up chloe, ni hindi nya pa nga na ilagay ang singsing kay Chloe sa sobrang saya nya  <br>
            <br>
            
            "I love you I love you I love you I love you" He repeatedly screams as He sways his now fiancé, Chloe. 
             alam ni Ry na Masamang mag yabang pero puta, sya na ata ang pinaka-masaya at pinaka-swerteng lalaki sa buong mundo.   <br>
             <br>
            
            "WOAHHH! TANGINAAA! HE SAID YESS!!"   <br>
            <br>
            
            "ibaba mo na ako" Chloe said smacking his fiancé's shoulders.  
             FIANCÉ shet an sarap pakinggan  <br>
             <br>
            
            Ryan carefully got him down, he slowly put the ring onto chloe's finger  <br>
            <br>
            
            "Perfect Fit" Ry commented as he intertwined their fingers together   <br>
            <br>
            
            "sigurado ka na d'yan ha? di mo ng pwedeng ibalik samin yan"  
             A loud voice said, chloe knows where that came from 
            a they turn they both got ambush by their entire friend group  <br>
            <br>
            
            "Hannie? really? is ka sa may pakana?"  <br>
            <br>
            
            "you're welcome my baby coco"   <br>
            <br>
            
            "hina mo naman Ryan, dapat noong nag oo hinalikan mo hindi binuhat" hoshi commented   <br>
            <br>
            
            "actually hindi ka invited sa kasal namin"  Ry casually uninvited Hoshi, ni hindi pa nga nakakapag plano uninvited na agad?  <br>
            <br>
            
            "sorry sorry, I meant hindi kayo invited" Ry added pointing at Hoshi and Evie  <br>
            <br>
            
            "ehhh?? bakit pati ako?? Fyi Ry kababata ko yang si Coco, kaya it's impossible na i-uninvite nya ako sa kasal nyo" Evie said full of confidence   <br>
            <br>
            
            "what my fiancé said, my fiancé said. if he doesn't want you two in the weddings wala akong mamagawa" Chloe agreed on what Ry said   <br>
            <br>
            
            "unless.... you two... could talk to each other like before, I'll consider you guys coming" Chloe added as he smiled mischievously  <br>
            <br>
            
            "ano pang pag-uusapan?? okay kayo okay kami"   <br>
            <br>
            
            "if you say so"</p>
